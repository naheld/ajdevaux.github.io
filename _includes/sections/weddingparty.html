      The Best Man is A.J.'s younger brother, and an accomplished debater
          and computer expert. He's known A.J. literally his whole life, but
          dont hold that against him! He's one of the most generous
          people there is.

      <img src="images/garvey_sq.png" alt="headshot" style="padding:5px 5px; float:left" width="150" height="150" />
      Possibly the smartest man in the room, Garvey recently received his Ph.D. in
      chemistry, but he's very humble so don't tell him I told you! He is also fluent in French and
      hails from the island of Dominica, and moved up to Boston for school, where he met A.J.

      A philosopher and class act. Craig is also recently engaged himself to
      his college sweetheart, Melissa Trenholme. Craig loves games, philosophical
      discussions, and amusing esoterica. Needless to say, he is always fun at a party.

      This guy right here is a seeker. He has changed a lot since A.J. met him in Elementary School, and is someone you can count on.
      He has kept his great sense of humor, his artistic ability, and his winning attitude.
